- GitLab Repository
  - We’ve setup a private GitLab repository for the book club.
  - Whilst reading the book, you can raise an issue to be discussed, for example:
    - Have an issue running sample code.
    - Need help understanding a concept described by the book.
    - A suggestion for a topic or question to be raised with the Author.
  - Issues are being used to manage this so that it easy to search and allow people to read the book at their own pace.
  - The project within the repo is a Hugo site, this renders markdown files into blog posts.
  - Issues can be upgraded to a blog post which can be made publicly available.
- Slack Channel
  - We have a Slack channel setup for real time discussion.
  - The channel is linked to the repository so you’re notified if an issue is raised.
- Google Meet / Hangout
  - For online discussions we’ll be using Google Meet.
  - This is what we’ll use to talk to the author at the end of the book.
  - We’ll schedule a fortnightly meet to have a discussion about the book.
  - Its recommended to join one of these meets prior to the author meet to get used to the service.
