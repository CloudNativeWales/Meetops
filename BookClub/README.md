# BOOK CLUB

Cloud Native Wales (CNW) is focused on helping people learn new technologies and skills.

From our own personal experiences, we're beginning to see companies improve their employee development offerings, but you cannot be dependent on your job to help learn new technologies to help further your career. The CNW Book Club provides a space for people to discuss Cloud Native topics in which they are interested (whether for professional or personal reasons).

## Why a Book Club

All of the discussed books will be related to Cloud Native technologies. A Book Club has a number of benefits including:

* It doesn't matter where the reader is based geographically
* The reader doesn't need to configure any technology to read a book (beyond a PDF reader!)
* Learning as a community makes it more likely the reader will complete the book
* People can support each other to understand complex processes/concepts

## Connect with the Author

At the end of the Book Club, a hangout (video conference call) with the author (typically a subject matter **expert**) takes place.  Members of the Book Club can ask questions, say thank you or give interesting examples of the problems that the book may have helped them solve.

## What do people get from this

### Book Club Members

The digital landscape is constantly and quickly evolving. If you've been working the same job for the last 5 years, it's possible that you were hired based on your knowledge of a 5 year old technology and are continuing to use it regularly. Looking to get a new job or suggest improvements to the current solution is tough as the individual doesn't have experience in what they're trying to start. Using the Book Club as an example of experience using a technology can give confidence to the individual to say that they are not only familiar with a technology, but have spoken to the author of the book, and remain connected with a community of like-minded people who can offer support.

### Authors

Authors are able to have their book shared and discussed by a community. They can receive feedback about the book as well as see how their work has empowered people to better themselves and create new opportunities for their careers and the companies for which they work. Authors may choose to offer their book to members at a discount, but we're not expecting them to offer the book to members for free, even though some have been kind enough to do so.

### Businesses

The Book Club helps to improve the skill and knowledge level within your organisation.
