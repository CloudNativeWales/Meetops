# BOOK CLUB

Cloud Native Wales (CNW) are focused on helping people learn new technologies and skills.

From our own personal experiences, you cannot be dependent on your job to help learn new technologies to help further your career.  This is not a fault with businesses, and we're starting to see better company benefits and attitudes towards employee development.  This is set up to help those who currently don't have that on offer.

## Why a Book Club

Books are chosen related to Cloud Native technologies.  A Book Club has a number of benefits including:

* It doesn't matter where you are geographically based.
* You don't need any technology set up to read a book.
* A community can be set up connecting like-minded individuals.
* Learning as a community makes it more likely an individual will complete the book.
* People can support eachother to understand complex processes.

## Connect with the Author

If you've written a technical book on a topic, it's generally considered that you have a deep understanding of said technology.  At the end of the Book Club, we organise a hangout (video conference call) with the Author.  Members of the Book Club can ask questions or just say thank you.

## What do people get from this

### Book Club Members

They get the chance to learn something new.  The digital landscape is constantly changing and moving forward.  If you've been working the same job for the last 5 years, its likely that the technology is 5 years old.  Looking to get a new job or suggest improvements to the current solution is tough as the individual doesn't have experience in what they're trying to start.

Using the Book Club as an example of experience using a technology, it will give confidence to the individual to say that they do know a technology, that they are connected with a community of like minded people who can offer support as well as knowing the Author of the book.

### Authors

For authors, they get to have their book shared and discussed by a community.  They can receive feedback about the book as well as see how their work has empowered people to better themselves and create new opportunities for their careers.

### Businesses

With staff learning new skills it means that the business will have new opportunities to solve their problems and further enhance their products.  If there is a fear of loosing staff due to personal development, then there are bigger problems with the said business that a Book Club cannot solve.  Having a highly skilled workforce will improve the quality of output and make said business more competitive in their marketplace.
