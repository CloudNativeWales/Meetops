* Event Description
  * We host a monthly meetup in Cardiff where we invite speakers to present their talks on Cloud Native technologies.  This month we have Basia Fusinska (from Google) and Ben Hall (from Team Katacoda) talking all things KubeFlow.  The meetup is held at the DevOpsGuys office on the 22nd floor in Capital Tower, Cardiff with fantastic views across the city.  Food and drink will also be available, kindly sponsored by The DevOpsGuys.  (If you have any dietary requirements, please contact us prior to the meetup).
* Area of innovation being demonstrated

* Who should attend
  * Anyone who is interested in Cloud Native technologies.  We invite beginners who are new to the topic all the way to the professionals who can share their stories.  By the end of the meetup, you'll take away new ideas and feel part of a growing community.
* Benefits of attending
  * We're building a strong Cloud Native community not just in Cardiff, but Wales.  We offer great talks with exceptional speakers as well as like minded attendees to share and discuss ideas with.
