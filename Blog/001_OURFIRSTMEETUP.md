# OUR FIRST MEETUP

It's a common start to any meetup story...it started in a bar after a couple of beers.

I ([@denhamparry](https://twitter.com/denhamparry)) attended [NDC London](https://ndc-london.com/agenda/) at the start of 2018 and was booked in for a Kubernetes Workshop with [Ben Hall](https://twitter.com/ben_hall).  Speaking with Ben after the workshop I mentioned that I was trying to get into speaking at events and meetups, to which he said "Well, I don't think anyone has set up Cloud Native Wales...".

From this point, [Cloud Native Wales (CNW)](https://cloudnativewales.io) [@cloudnativewal](https://twitter.com/cloudnativewal), or *Brodorion y Cwmwl Cymru* was born.  That night I spoke to [Salman](https://twitter.com/soulmaniqbal) with the news, who had been working on a *Kubernetes 101* workshop concept. He was just as excited as I was.

Later that week during NDC London, we had our first workshop confirmed in Cardiff. We spent a number of weeks preparing for the 3 hour event which is blogged about [here](https://katacoda.com/blog/). 31 people attended and we operated a traffic light review system (green/amber/red tickets in a bowl at the end to provide feedback). We were so happy to find we had 29 green tickets and two amber. With this feedback we knew we had people in Wales interested in this technology and confirmed to us that the capital would have a good chance of sustaining a Cloud Native Wales meetup.

Salman and I started to plan how to create this event - the only experience I'd had of hosting of any kind was house parties. To help us get started, we attended a lot of Meetups in London to see how they were presented and to speak to the organisers and presenters to get some tips.

This was the first uncomfortable situation we found ourselves in: we need a venue, speakers and attendees, where do we start?!?

The first step was creating a Cloud Native Wales meetup group.  To set this up it cost around Â£75 for the year. After setting up, we put some 'Cloud like' images as the logo and emulated other Cloud Native group biographies.

By the very next day we'd already had people join the Meetup group. We knew that we'd found our attendees but didn't have any speakers or venue.

I started to look for speakers, we had people lined up from London but was concerned that there would only be 3 attendees and all the surnames would be the same. I started to look for people from around the Cardiff area to give talks, after all it **is** Cloud Native **Wales**, so thought people closer to home could give a talk, and they'd at the very least have friends who'd come and see them give a talk. This is how we found Matthew. I looked through the Cardiff Dev Slack 'Meetup' channel, and had seen that he had presented a talk in Bristol on 'Docker and IoT'. Instantly I DM'd him and he quickly confirmed that he was eager to take part!

During this time, Salman had secured a space to give a lightning talk at a local conference, DDD Wales.  He gave a talk on 'Can a robot develop my website', with the final slides showing a shameless plug for Cloud Native Wales with contact details. At the time I was on a stag do (bachelor party) in Manchester in the middle of a go-kart Grand Prix, but received a DM from one of the attendees saying that they were looking to found a similar Meetup.

After talking for a couple of days, he said that his friend James would be interested in giving a talk on a project that he was currently working on: Jenkins X. We'd found our second speaker.

The only thing missing was a venue. Salman and I figured out how much money we could both invest into getting a venue in Cardiff sorted and started looking around. The following day we saw that there was a WinOps meetup at Just Eat in Bristol, so thought we'd attend to get a feel for it and met some people form the DevOpsGuys (DOG).

We spoke to their CTO who introduced us to their Head of Recruitment Anthony.  Anthony and I instantly recognised each other as we worked at Salisbury's together when we were 17 pushing trolleys.  We caught up and then he offered their office to host our event. Venue, speakers and attendees were sorted!

That night we also bumped into [Aled](https://twitter.com/a_ll_james) for the second time. Aled is a researcher from Bristol University and is originally from Carmarthen, West Wales.  We first met Aled at our 'Kubernetes 101' workshop and got on well with him. He asked whether there was anything he could do to help. At that moment, he became Co-Organiser of CNW.

The week before the meetup, Salman and I attended KubeCon in Copenhagen, focusing on promoting Cloud Native Wales and connecting with as many people as possible for support.  We met so many great people and were amazed by the generosity and time everyone offered us.  We also managed to get two authors to confirm that they'd be happy working with us on a Book Club initiative that we're rolling out across Wales.  More information on that here.

We left KubeCon buzzing, the support given showed that we had support from a vast, diverse community.  We just needed to connect it to Wales.

The day before our first meetup, I gave a talk at [Bristol Cloud Native](https://twitter.com/briscloudnative). The talk was based on announcements and talks from KubeCon. We mentioned CNW, and after the talk I started chatting to someone. He created a start up in his parents' garage in West Wales and, along with two former coursemates, is now working in an incubator in Bristol. This was another positive indicator for CNW, having not only found that a significant number of people in Wales were interested in taking part in a Cloud Native meetup, but that there were businesses being founded with an interest/focus on Cloud Native technologies.
