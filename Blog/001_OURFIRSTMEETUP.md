# OUR FIRST MEETUP

Its a common start to a meetup story, it started in a bar after a couple of beers.

I ([@denhamparry](https://twitter.com/denhamparry)) attended NDC London at the start of the year (2018) and was booked in for a Kubernetes Workshop with [Ben Hall](https://twitter.com/ben_hall).  Speaking with Ben after the workshop I mentioned that I was tryng to get into speaking at events and meetups, to which he said "Well, I don't think anyone has setup Cloud Native Wales...".

From this point, [Cloud Native Wales (CNW)](https://cloudnativewales) [@cloudnativewal](https://twitter.com/cloudnativewal) was born.  That night I spoke to [Salman](https://twitter.com/soulmaniqbal) with the news, we had been working on a *Kubernetes 101* workshop concept.  He was just as excited as I was.

Later that week during NDC London, we hd our first workshop confirmed in Cardiff, Wales.  We spent a number of weeks preparing for the 3 hour event which is blogged about [here](https://katacoda.com/blog/).  31 people attended and we opperated a traffic light review system (green/amber/red tickets in a bowl at the end to provide feedback).  We were so happy to find we had 29 green tickets and two amber.  With this feedback we knew we had people in Cardiff interested in this technology and felt that it was a great place to start Cloud Native Wales.

Salman and I started to plan how to create this event, the only experience I've had of hosting anything like this was from house parties.  To help get started, we travelled to a lot of Meetups in London to see how they were presented and to speak to the organisers and presenters to get some tips.

This was the first uncomfortable situation we found ourselves in, we need a venue, speakers and attendees, where do we start?!?

The first step was creating a Cloud Native Wales meetup group.  To set this up it cost around £75 for the year.  After setting up, we put some 'Cloud like' images as the logo and copied other Cloud Native group biographies.

The next day, we had people already join the Meetup, we found our attendees but didn't have any speakers or venue.

I started to look for speakers, we had people lined up from London but was concerned that there would only be 3 attendees and all the surnames would be the same.  I started to look for people to give talks from around the area, after all its Cloud Native Wales so thought people closer to home could give a talk, and they'd have friends who'd come and see them give a talk.  This is how we found Matthew.  I looked through the Cardiff Dev Slack 'Meetup' channel, and had seen he had presented a talk in Bristol on 'Docker and IoT'.  Instantly I direct messaged (DM) him and he confirmed that he was up for it!

During this time, Salman had got a space to give a lightning talk at a local conference, DDD Wales.  He gave a talk on 'Can a robot develop my website', with the final slides showing a shameless plug about Cloud Native Wales with contact details.  I was on a stag do in Manchester at the time in the middle of a go-kart Grand Prix, but recieved a DM from one of the attendees saying that they were looking to set a simular Meetup.

After talking for a couple of days, he said that his friend James would be interested in giving a talk on a project that he was currently working on, Jenkins X.  We found our second speaker.

The only thing missing was a venue.  Salman and I figured out how much money we could both invest into getting a venue in Cardiff sorted and started looking around.  The following day we saw that there was a WinOps meetup at Just Eat in Bristol, so thought we'd attened to get a feel for it and met some people form the DevOpsGuys (DOG).

We spoke to their CTO who introduced us to their Head of Recruitment Anthony.  Anthony and I instantly recognised eachother as we worked at Sainsburys together when we were 17 pushing trollies.  We caught up and then he offered their office to host our event.  Venue, speakers and attendees were sorted!

The week before the meetup, Salman and I attended KubeCon in Copenhagen, focusing on promoting Cloud Native Wales and connecting with as many people as possible for support.  We met so many great people and were amazed by the generosity and time everyone offered us.  We also managed to get two authors to confirm that they'd be happy working with us on a Book Club inicative that we're rolling out across Wales.  More information on that here.

We left KubeCon buzzing, the support given showed that we had support from a vast, diverse community.  We just need to connect it to Wales.
