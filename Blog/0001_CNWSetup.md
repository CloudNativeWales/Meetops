# OUR FIRST MEETUP

Its a common start to a meetup story, it started in a bar after a couple of beers.

I ([@denhamparry](https://twitter.com/denhamparry)) attended NDC London at the start of the year (2018) and was booked in for a Kubernetes Workshop with [Ben Hall](https://twitter.com/ben_hall).  Speaking with Ben after the workshop I mentioned that I was trying to get into speaking at events and meetups, to which he said "Well, I don't think anyone has set up Cloud Native Wales...".

From this point, [Cloud Native Wales (CNW)](https://cloudnativewales) [@cloudnativewal](https://twitter.com/cloudnativewal) was born.  That night I spoke to [Salman](https://twitter.com/soulmaniqbal) with the news, we had been working on a *Kubernetes 101* workshop concept.  He was just as excited as I was.

Later that week, we had our first workshop confirmed in Cardiff, Wales.  We spent a number of weeks preparing for the 3 hour event which is blogged about [here](https://katacoda.com/blog/).  31 people attended and was a resounding success. This showed us that there was interest in Cloud Native technologies in Cardiff. 

Salman and I started to plan how to create this event, the only experience I've had of hosting anything like this was from house parties. We attended as many meetups as we could to get the tips from the community.

We set up Cloud Native Wales meetup group and picked a 'Cloud like' image as the logo and used group biographies from elsewhere as a starting point. We didn't have a venue or any speakers, yet people joined the group. Encouraging signs! 
# The first step was creating a Cloud Native Wales meetup group.  To set this up it cost around Â£75 for the year.  After setting up, we put some 'Cloud like' images as the logo and copied other Cloud Native group biographies.
#The next day, we had people already join the Meetup, we found our attendees but didn't have any speakers or venue.

We stepped up the search for speakers. On Cardiff Dev Slack 'Meetup' channel, I noticed that [Matthew Wallace](https://twitter.com/MBConsultingUK) had presented a talk in Bristol on 'Docker and IoT'.  Instantly, I direct messaged (DM) him and he confirmed that he was up for it! 
#I started to look for speakers, we had people lined up from London but was concerned that there would only be 3 attendees and all the surnames would be the same.  I started to look for people to give talks from around the area, after all its Cloud Native Wales so thought people closer to home could give a talk, and they'd have friends who'd come and see them give a talk.  This is how we found Matthew.  I looked through the Cardiff Dev Slack 'Meetup' channel, and had seen he had presented a talk in Bristol on 'Docker and IoT'.  Instantly I direct messaged (DM) him and he confirmed that he was up for it!

Meanwhile, Salman gave a lightning talk at DDD Wales in Swansea titled 'Can a robot code my website'. It ended with a shameless plug about Cloud Native Wales. I was on a stag do in Manchester in the middle of go-kart Grand Prix and received a DM from one of the attendees saying that they were looking to set a similar Meetup.  
#During this time, Salman had got a space to give a lightning talk at a local conference, DDD Wales.  He gave a talk on 'Can a robot develop my website', with the final slides showing a shameless plug about Cloud Native Wales with contact details.  I was on a stag do in Manchester at the time in the middle of a go-kart Grand Prix, but received a DM from one of the attendees saying that they were looking to set a similar Meetup.

He said that his friend James would be interested in giving a talk on a project that he was currently working on, Jenkins X.  We had found our second speaker!
#After talking for a couple of days, he said that his friend James would be interested in giving a talk on a project that he was currently working on, Jenkins X.  We found our second speaker.

Until we met Steve, co-founder of DevOpsGuys (DOG) at a WinOps meetup in Bristol, a basement in a cafe in Cardiff was our venue. I also connected with Anthony Gallagher, Head of Recruitment at DOG. Anthony and I used to push trolleys together at Sainsbury's when we were 17! The folks at DOG offered to host us for a year. Thier offices are probably the most stunning offices in center of Cardiff. Don't believe us, check out the photos. Still don't beleive us, come and check it out at the next Cloud Native Wales meetup! Venue, speakers and attendees sorted!
#The only thing missing was a venue.  Salman and I figured out how much money we could both invest into getting a venue in Cardiff sorted and started looking around.  The following day we saw that there was a WinOps meetup at Just Eat in Bristol, so thought we'd attend to get a feel for it and met some people form the DevOpsGuys (DOG).

#We spoke to their CTO who introduced us to their Head of Recruitment Anthony.  Anthony and I instantly recognised each other as we worked at Salisbury's together when we were 17 pushing trolleys.  We caught up and then he offered their office to host our event.  Venue, speakers and attendees were sorted!

[Aled](https://twitter.com/a_ll_james), joined us as a Co-Organiser of CNW. Aled is a researcher from Bristol University and is originally from Carmarthen, Wales.
#That night we also bumped into [Aled](https://twitter.com/a_ll_james) again, Aled is a researcher from Bristol University and is originally from Carmarthen, Wales.  We first met Aled at our 'Kubernetes 101' workshop and we got on well with him.  He asked if there was anything he could do to help.  At that moment, he became Co-Organiser of CNW.

The week before the meetup, Salman and I attended KubeCon in Copenhagen and promoted Cloud Native Wales. We met so many great people and were amazed by the generosity and time everyone offered to us.  We also managed to get two authors to confirm that they'd be happy working with us on a Book Club initiative that we're rolling out across Wales.  More information on that here.

#We left KubeCon buzzing, the support given showed that we had support from a vast, diverse community.  We just need to connect it to Wales.

#The day before our first meetup, I gave a talk at [Bristol Cloud Native](https://twitter.com/briscloudnative).  The talk was based on announcements and talks from KubeCon.  We mentioned CNW, and after the talk I started chatting to someone.  He created a start up in his parents garage in West Wales and are now working in an incubator in Bristol.  This was another positive indicator for CNW, finding that people weren't only interested in Wales, but creating businesses based on the technology.

With the explosion of cloud native technologies, we created CNW as a way to bring together a community that would share ideas on how to use cloud native technolgies more effectively. We started the book club intiative to kickstart a more in-depth learning and understanding of these concepts and connect with the authors. Our hope is that through this community, the members would introduce newer technologies at workplaces, businesses and projects and imporve ourselves every single day. 

Watch out for the next blog to see how the first meetup went!
