Sam has found himself spending much of the past few years dealing with buzzword-heavy areas of technology, trying to come to terms with what it all means. From DevOps, to Microservices, serverless and now Cloud Native. So many of these terms mean different things to different people. In an effort to try and set us up with a common understanding of what Cloud Native is, Sam will be taking us on a whistle-stop tour through the history leading up to Cloud Native, and try and synthesise what it is, and why itâ€™s important.

From the emergence of public cloud to the all consuming hype around Kubernetes, from 12 factors to servlerless, Sam will pull all these strands together to help us understand how everything is related, everything is new, and everything is old all at the same time.
