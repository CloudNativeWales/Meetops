# Lightning Talk

Lewis (https://twitter.com/denhamparry) presented a lightning talk at [Swansea Software Development Meetup (SSDM)](https://www.meetup.com/Swansea-Software-Development-Meetup/events/250343517/)  about the new Cloud Native Wales (CNW) Book Club initiative.

The venue that SSDM have at [TechHub, Swansea](https://swansea.techhub.com/) is fantastic.  Its a 2 minute walk from the train station and a really comfortable area to watch and give talks.

The lightning talk was based on the [Ignite](//www.ignitetalks.io/) format of 15 seconds per slide with a total of 20 slides.

Tips learned include:

* Make sure your speaker notes are in-sync with the slides (you will witness some awkward fumbling at the start).
* 15 seconds isn't long enough to explain topics in detail.
* 15 seconds are perfect to get precise points across.

We filmed the event ourselves, which can be seen here:

Other talks included static site generators (Hugo getting a lot of love), analogies of what development is, why its financially exciting to be a developer at the moment (especially in Wales) and an introduction into BitCoin concepts.
